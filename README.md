# Simon-Says

Simon Says is a browser-based memory game that challenges users to follow an ever-growing sequence of colors. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, this project replicates the classic 80s arcade experience with modern enhancements like sound control, high score tracking, and responsive design.

This was my first fully functional JavaScript project and served as a practical introduction to DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, and game logic.
